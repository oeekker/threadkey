# Note to translators:
# Before changing the key, please check if it's customary to change keyboard
# shortcuts, for example by comparing the following items and see if they
# make sense in your locale:
#
#   View    > Sort By      > Grouped By Sort  G
#   Go      > Next         > Unread Thread    T
#   Message > New Message  Ctrl+N
#             Reply        Ctrl+R
#
# If they are unchanged, please leave the key following keyboard shortcuts
# also unchanged.
#
# If no key needs to be overridden, leave the id, key and modifiers empty.
#
