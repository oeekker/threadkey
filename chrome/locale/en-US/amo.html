        <TD>
          <P>This is a very simple extension that let the user strike the 'T' key and get the Threaded view, just like the 'G' key switches to Grouped By Sort view by default. You can also strike the 'U' key in order to get back the Unthreaded view.</P>
          <P>Even if you don't use threaded view a lot, it can come in handy, if you happen to press 'G' by accident. This extension helps you to easily switch back to threaded or Unthreaded/Ungrouped view with a single keypress.</P>
          <P>Thunderbird <A href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=275871" title="VERIFIED FIXED &ndash; View->Sort By->Grouped by Sort keyboard shortcut goes against interface guidelines (back out bug 263919)">bug&nbsp;275871</A> was "fixed" and this means that the 'G' key doesn't put Thunderbird into Grouped By Sort view anymore. I have released <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/thunderbird/addon/threadkey/versions/0.5">version 0.5</a>, so people using my extension can continue to switch to Grouped By Sort view with the 'G' key...</P>
          <P>Please note that the 'T' key is currently assigned to the "Go ? Next ? Unread Thread" menu item: this key assignment will be replaced by 'Shift+T'.</P>

          <P>There is a known error with this extension with Thunderbird 2.* on Mac OS X. Redefining T/U effectively disables T/U throughout Thunderbird. There is a temporary version with alternate shortcut keys Cmd+T/Cmd+U for the Mac available for download under See All Versions and on the ThreadKey Homepage...</P>
