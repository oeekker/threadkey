description=<P>This is a very simple extension that let the user strike the 'T' key and get the Threaded view, just like the 'G' key switches to Grouped By Sort view by default. You can also strike the 'U' key in order to get back the Unthreaded view.</P><P>Please note that the 'T' key is currently assigned to the menu item 'Go &gt; Next &gt; Unread Thread': this key assignment will be replaced by 'Shift+T'.</P>

# Technical Details
#
developer.comments=Although the add-on is now restartless, there seems to be a problem in Thunderbird that a key that has been used stays active, even if it is changed later by the add-on. If this happens, you'll have to restart Thunderbird to get the keys working correctly again.

version0.7=Fixed error in keyboard modifiers for view by Unthreaded sort
version1.0=Converted the add-on to a restartless (bootstrapped) add-on
